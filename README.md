# Vision Transformer for Image Classification

This repository contains an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) using PyTorch. The project demonstrates the complete workflow for training a ViT-based model on an image classification task, including data preparation, model architecture, training loop, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Overview

Transformers have revolutionized the NLP domain and are now extending their power to the vision domain. The Vision Transformer (ViT) treats image patches as sequences and processes them with transformer blocks. This project builds a ViT model from scratch and applies it to classify images from datasets such as CIFAR-10 or similar.
